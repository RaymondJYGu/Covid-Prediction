# Short term COVID-19 prediction model using MCMC simulation

This project is created by Zefan Qian(https://github.com/zefanqian) and Raymond Gu in a Bayesian statistics class.

A bookdown of the project can be found here: https://bookdown.org/qianzefancharlie/stat454_final_project_raymond_zefan/

Bayesians use statistical methods that assign probabilities or distributions to events (such as rain tomorrow) or parameters (such as a population mean) based on experience or best guesses before experimentation and data collection and that apply. We derive our priors from simple visualizations and use Monte Carlo and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to approximate posterior models.

This project aims to investigate how factors such as state and time can help us predict future COVID-19 outbreaks. The investigation potentially can help people decide to what places and at what time are they safe to travel if they have to.
