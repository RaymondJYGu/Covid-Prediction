# Short term COVID-19 prediction model using MCMC simulation

This project is created by Zefan Qian(https://github.com/zefanqian) and Raymond Gu in a Bayesian statistics class.

A bookdown of the project can be found here: https://bookdown.org/qianzefancharlie/stat454_final_project_raymond_zefan/

This project aims to investigate how factors such as state and time can help us predict future COVID-19 outbreaks. The investigation potentially can help people decide to what places and at what time are they safe to travel if they have to.
